## Background

You have been hired as a consultant for the online retailing company Contoso Ltd. which run an e-commerce website with a in-house developed sales system as the back-end. The sales system suffers from quality issues: the code lacks a clear structure, good readability and have a high maintenence cost. They want you to come in and create a new system and apply best-practice design and SOLID coding principles.

## Business requirements

The component which you have been assigned to is a recommendation component for products. Users who visit their website should see suggested products based on given properties, e.g. user properties, seasonal properties, product properties. This way they can target spesific products to spesific users and this will lead to a higher conversion rate for visitors that see a product and end up creating new sales orders with this product.

The recommendation system must be extendible becasue there are new properties being suggested and being created all of the time from senior sales management.

At the moment, these are the properties that are approved and should be implemented (also called "SalesMode" internally in the system): ***Gender***, ***Low-cost*** and ***Season***

* **Gender**: If the user is a male, then present him with products marked as appropriate for males (razor blades, men-magazines etc)
* **Low-cost**: If the product is marked as a low-cost product, use this to show the products to cost-aware users (99-cents items etc)
* **Season**: If it's mid-winter then the system should recommend skiis, ice-skates, winter clothing etc.

## Technical requirements

The customer wants you to build the system as a proof-of-concept console application.

### Patterns & Anti-patterns

Refactor in: *Strategy, IoC*

Refactor out anti-patterns: *Arrow, Blob*

## Assignment tasks

### Java-version of the assignments

### Assignment task #1

In the method static void Main(string[] args) in Program.cs you see there's instaces of hardcoded SalesModes being used in a nested if-block (Arrow Anti-pattern) that selects recommondation classes. Replace this with an implementation of the Strategy-pattern for selecting the appropriate product recommender in runtime, based on a SalesMode as input value from the console. As an additional option, read customer's gender from the console also and use this value to get even more precise product recommendations.

Input:

    Read SalesMode as a number from the console (0=Gender, 1=Low-cost, 2=Season)
    Read Gender as a number from the console (0=Male, 1=Female)

Output

    Product name and the type of the IProductRecommender to console.
        Example: "<product name>, Recommender: <recommender's class name>"

 

a) Read SalesMode as input from console into a local variable called "salesMode"

b) Read Gender as input from console into a local variable called "gender"

c) Implement the Strategy-classes GenderProductRecommender, LowCostProductRecommender og SeasonProductRecommender.

    Hint: use an arbitrary product name. Implementing or connecting to a product database is outside the scope of these assignments.

d) Implement the method public Product Recommend(SalesMode salesMode, Customer customer) in the SalesEngine-class

e) Create a new local variable called "salesEngine" and instansiate an object of type SalesEngine. Provide it with instantiated product recommenders in its constructor.

f) Input "salesMode" and "customer" to salesEngine's "Recommend"-method and retrieve a product.

 

You have now a working product recommender that selects an IProductRecommender-implementation at runtime!

It can be improved apon further by using IoC and DI to retrieve SalesEngine and provide it with the product recommenders rather than instantiating them directly. See the next assignment

### Assignment task #2

You have now implemented the different classes needed, so now you can bind it all together with IoC (Autofac) to retrieve SalesEngine and find a recommended product based on given SalesMode in runtime with the use of IProductRecommender-implementations.

 

a) Install NuGet-package "Autofac".

b) Initialize Autofac after you have read the SalesMode into "salesMode" from the console in static void Main(string[] args) in Program.cs

var containerBuilder = new ContainerBuilder();

containerBuilder.RegisterModule<AutofacBuilder>();

using (var container = containerBuilder.Build())

{

// TODO: Assigment 2 c) & d)

}

c) Change the method public Product Recommend(SalesMode salesMode, Customer customer) in the SalesEngine-class to match on Metadata

    Hint: In the list _recommenders you will find a match on a recommender that has the property Metadata equalling the method parameter salesMode. Run its Recommend()-method to find a product

d) Implement the method protected override void Load(ContainerBuilder builder) in the AutofacBuilder-class

    Register the type SalesEngine with AsImplementedInterfaces
    Register the type GenderProductRecommender with AsImplementedInterfaces and with metadata class ProductRecommenderMetadata for property SalesMode which should be set to SalesMode.Gender.
        Do the equivalent to LowPriceProductRecommender and SeasonalProductRecommender with SalesMode.LowCost and SalesMode.Seasonal

e) Modify your local variable "salesEngine" to use Autofac to resolve ISalesEngine to the type SalesEngine.

## Summary

After you have completed all of the assignments you should be able to get a recommended product returned the system based on a given SalesMode.

You have now created a reusable and isolated product recommendation component that can be imported into and used in the e-commerce system by inputing a SalesMode and getting products back via a IProductRecommender in runtime.

You have implemented the Strategy-pattern by using the SalesEngine as the Context and different implementations of IProductRecommender as concrete Strategies. IProductRecommender is adhering to the Open/Closed-principle by being open for extension but closed for modification. The team can therefore now consentrate on creating Strategy-implementations and testing these without touching the IProductRecommender-interface or the SalesEngine.

You have also seen that IoC and Dependency Inversion lets you code against interfaces/abstractions and not concrete implementations, allowing a better abstraction level in the code, higher testability and reduces coupling between classes (low coupling / high cohesion)

If you have achieved all of this then one can say that you have done a SOLID piece of work (smile)
