Design patterns - A practical introduction to the Strategy pattern
==================================================================

## Introduction

This design patterns workshop focuses on the Strategy design pattern and how it can be used so solve a design problem where you discover the Arrow anti-pattern and need to refactor to the Strategy pattern.

This workshop, along with its assignments, focuses on practical and hands-on use of patterns and its uses in real-life business and software design scenarios.

## Prerequisites

### .Net
* Have installed Visual Studio 2012/2013
* Have installed the NuGet package manager extension

### Java
* Have installed Eclipse/JBoss or equivalent

## Assignments

[The assignments](https://github.com/HenrikWM/SystemutviklerskolenStrategyPattern/blob/master/ASSIGNMENTS.md) use the same business case for both .Net and Java, with separate programming tasks for each.

To start the assignments, go to the folder [**/begin**](https://github.com/HenrikWM/Systemutviklerskolen2013DesignPatternsWorkshopCSharp/tree/master/begin) ([**/java-begin**](https://github.com/HenrikWM/Systemutviklerskolen2013DesignPatternsWorkshopCSharp/tree/master/java-begin)). Copy the files to your local computer and then start with the tasks in the assignment.

If for some reason you get stuck or need clarification on a specific task, then look at the files in [**/end**](https://github.com/HenrikWM/Systemutviklerskolen2013DesignPatternsWorkshopCSharp/tree/master/end) ([**/java-end**](https://github.com/HenrikWM/Systemutviklerskolen2013DesignPatternsWorkshopCSharp/tree/master/java-end)) to have a look at the suggested solution.
